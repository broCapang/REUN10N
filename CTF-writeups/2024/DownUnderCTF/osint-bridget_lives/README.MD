# Bridget Lives
Solved by **yappare**

## Question
After dropping numerous 0days last year Bridget has flown the coop. This is the last picture she posted before going dark. Where was this photo taken from?

NOTE: Flag is case-insensitive and requires placing inside DUCTF{}! e.g. DUCTF{name_of_building}

## Solution
The image !(lives)[https://i.ibb.co/XZY7yLy/bridget.png] looks like somewhere in Asia. We asked Geospy.AI and it determined it was in Singapore. We asked Google Images and from the results, we assumed it was Jiak Kim Bridge, however the building from the angle has no name. We increase the eagle view and found another bridge that looks similar, Robertson Bridge. There's a tall building that fits the angle.
