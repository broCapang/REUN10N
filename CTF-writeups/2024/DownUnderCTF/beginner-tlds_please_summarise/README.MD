## Question
I thought I was being 1337 by asking AI to help me solve challenges, now I have to reinstall Windows again. Can you help me out by finding the flag in this document?

## Solution
Used MS Word to open the documents. At first glance there is nothing but on the 2nd page, when highlighting all the documents, there are some hidden texts. Copy the blank and paste it into any text editor will reveal this.
