## Question
We have the best marketing team!

Except for that one monke that looks like they slapped something together...

Maybe the bot should lock away that monke to stopping posting stuff online. The other animals should be free, just not the monke.

## Solution
From the information, we deduced into few points:
- marketing via Linkedin
- marketing via Discord
- marketing via Twitter/X

We found nothing sus in Linkedin, and the organiser mentioned it does not relate to Discord. So we moved to Twitter/X. We found the following post by MC Fat Monke https://x.com/DownUnderCTF/status/1808025512478233062?t=euGCLIze98bL30Lox1Y6mw&s=33

We watched the short marketing video and the hint mentioned about "slapped together", and we found the animals (bottom right), means we were at the right track. We noted there's something on top left of the video.
