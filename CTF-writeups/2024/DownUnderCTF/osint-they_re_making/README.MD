## Question
The Sergeant from Clarence asked one of the Corporals to patrol for Emus to keep the our fresh troops on their toes and maybe scare some discipline into them. They headed out to an area with lots of sightings reported though they never made it back. Some of the last images uploaded showed what looked to be the enemy, though it turned out to be decoys. These broom heads are getting clever. I'm guessing we're not getting the camera equipment back...

Find the location (latitude, longitude) of this area rounded to 4 decimal places and wrap it in DUCTF{}, e.g. DUCTF{-25.3445,131.0354}

## Solution

We received the following image:\

Looking at the image, it seems taken from Google Maps. The question gives some hints like Clarence and step prints.\
The following website gave us the first clue to narrow down the target https://www.clarenceconversations.com.au/coastalemus/maps/coastal-emu-sightings-map#marker-58204
We looked into the grass' color and the shadow location to properly assume the location.
Following the road, we found the location.

### Flag
`DUCTF{-29.5505,153.2776}`
