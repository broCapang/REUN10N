# vietnam tourist 4

## Question
I have taken a photograph of the bridge, which is so gigantic. But I'm standing at a bridge too; do you know what the bridge name is that I'm standing at and the bridge name that I took the photo of?

Flag format: OSCTF{name_of_bridge_I_took_photo_of; name_of_bridge_I_was_standing_on}

E.g: OSCTF{Cầu_Thê_húc; Cầu_Cầm}

if you are not vietnamese, copy the exact name.
