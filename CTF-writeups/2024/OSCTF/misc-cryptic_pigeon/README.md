# Cryptic Pigeon
Solved by **zachwong_02**

## Question
This pigeon left me some letter but I just can't read it?

Note: Wrap what you decrypt in OSCTF{}. For example, if the decrypted text is: "hi" then the flag becomes OSCTF{hi}

## Solution
PigPen Cipher + A lil bit of guessing

### Flag
`OSCTF{P1GE0NG0BRRRR}`
