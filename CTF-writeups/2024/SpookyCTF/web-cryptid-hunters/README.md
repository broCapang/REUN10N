# cryptid-hunters

Solved by: @arifpeycal

## Question:
The intern found some web traffic originating from a known Consortium IP to this website. The website looks like a 7th grader's project.

Most of NICC took a look at it and blew it off, but Maya thinks there may be something worth looking into. Mary and the others tell her they are too busy and it is a waste of time. She is getting pretty sick and tired of no one taking her seriously. If she finds a lead she is going to follow it. NICC needs all the help they can get, whether its a Sasquatch or a giant clam!


## Solution:
login using `username=admin password=' OR '1`, then grep the flag

**Flag:** `NICC{1N_PuRSu1T_0F_4LL13S}`
