## Question:
Anna was driving in Queens and noticed these poles near the streetlights all in a straight line. We know that these are not standard street lights, but beyond that have no clue. We think this could be someone trying to signal aliens. Are you able to find out more information?

The flag consists of 3 parts. Once you determine what these poles do, you will have to find the following:

The poles are related to location X. location X has a 3 character, unique identifier associated with it. What is this identifier?

The poles are specifically for 2 parts of location X. These parts each also have a 3 character identifier, with the first 2 characters being the same. What are these 2 characters?

Between 7:47pm and 7:48pm (local time) on October 13th 2024, the poles were utilized as part of operation Y. operation Y has an identifier attached to it that ends with 3 numerical digits. What are these digits?

The flag is case insensitive.

## Solution:
Found reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/2qajk7/what_are_those_lights_along_the_belt_parkway_east/

second part can be the runway name

last part can be a flight number
