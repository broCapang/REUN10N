# they-have-returned

Solved by: @hikki

## Question:
Some user has came back nearly a year and a half after no known online activites to wreck havoc across the timeline. Their activity seems to suggest an attack is coming soon!


## Solution:
1. scroll up on channel discord #arrival
2. find a sus user (@d4rk_f4t3), he has a different role color
3. flag on his twitter

**Flag:** `NICC{Gue55_wh0'5_b4ck?}`
