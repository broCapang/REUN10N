# perfect-nba-fit

Solved by: @arifpeycal

## Question:
NJIT has a pretty good basketball team, but we could use some taller players to give us a big step in the right direction. We heard there was a creature in NJ who is a perfect fit, but we've got to find where they are. We heard they were last seen about 5 - 7 years ago, but can't remember the specifics - just that it was here in NJ and within a couple of hours of the school. Most of us commute anyway, so what's an hour or so to help our Highlanders get the edge?

Can you find where they were last seen? We need to be as specific as possible- anything less than a Class A sighting in NJ will not do. Get the exact day of the month, the approximate time using the 24 hour format, nearest road number and nearest town.


## Solution:
search for the latest sighting of Bigfoot, lead to this website https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=63235
