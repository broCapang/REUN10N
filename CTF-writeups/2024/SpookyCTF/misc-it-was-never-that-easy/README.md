## Question:
On his way back from a Sandy Hook River, Simon Letti discovered that the stash didn't only contain some piece of information but the evidence of the Consortium performing some bad things. There was another thing that he managed to retrieve from the stash, and it had so much information in it that he can't figure out what piece of information is hidden exactly. But because of his experience, something comes to his mindâ€”that this is something easy. Help Simmon Letti find the true information.
