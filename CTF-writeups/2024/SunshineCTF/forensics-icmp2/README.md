## Question:
Once again, we've captured some network traffic. Once again, we believe the opposition have been pinging some important information across... can you try and find the flag?

Open pcap file, sort by ICMP. the flag is now splitted into few ICMP requests.

**Flag:** `sun{1cmp_1s_4un_1337}`
