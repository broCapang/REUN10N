# Guessy Programmer 2

Solved by: @n3r

## Question:
Adventurer beware!

This challenge is not for the faint of heart.

Scour through history, through time, through place.

Wait it's not working this time.

No fair, this is a scripting challenge? How is making this be forensics fair?

Wait you say forensics is part of adventures? How? Why?

Automated forensics???

WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO ME???

PS
It's over, Anakin. I have the high regex.

([Oo][Bb][Ii])-+([Ww][Aa][Nn]) ?(K[Ee][Nn][Oo][Bb][iI])+==

## Solution:
```
git clone <source> <destination>
git log -p | grep "c3Vue" | grep "fQ"
```
`c3Vue` is `sun{` in b64
`fQ` is `}` in b64

**Flag:** `sun{base64_is_no_fair_that_requires_me_to_work_dude}`
