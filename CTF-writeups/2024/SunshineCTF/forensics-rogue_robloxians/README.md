# Rogue Robloxians

Solved by: @hikki

## Question:
We recently found a rogue author who went and published their flag generator. Luckily, we've checked and they've uploaded the wrong one, and so the real flag is safe! Surely we're good now, right?

## Solution:
1. https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-get-a-specific-place-version-without-having-to-use-robloxs-version-history/2890343
2. Read https://www.roblox.com/games/127150815094969/Flag-Generator to get the 2nd version of the game
3. go to their inventory to find their private games.
4. get the id of the game that is created at 10/10/2024.
5. download the 2nd version of the game from crafted link: https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v2/asset/?id=127150815094969&version=2
6. rename its file type to `.rbxl` and open in roblox studio to get the flag 

**Flag:** `sun{v3rs10n_c0ntr0l_v1a_r0bl0x?}`
