## Solution:

### Challenge Overview:

In this challenge, we were given a video and tasked with identifying a specific location within one of the scenes. The key to solving this challenge was recognizing the location and finding the original video online.

### Step 1: Screenshotting the Scene

I began by randomly taking a screenshot of a scene from the provided video.

### Step 2: Using Google Image Search

I uploaded the screenshot to [Google Image Search](https://images.google.com/) to see if it would recognize the location. The search results revealed that the place in the screenshot was *Shifa Hospital*, located in Gaza City.

### Step 3: Searching for the Video on YouTube

With this information, I opened YouTube and searched for videos related to Shifa Hospital. I specifically used the search query:  
`"shifa hospital gaza city jazeera"`

This brought up multiple videos related to the hospital, and I began watching each of them to match the reporter in the challenge video with those in the YouTube videos.

### Step 4: Finding the Exact Video

After carefully watching several related videos, I finally found the exact video that matched the scene and reporter from the challenge. The video was titled *"Gaza hospital struggles to cope with the wounded | Al Jazeera English"*, and I accessed it using this link:

**Key Learnings:**

- Reverse image search tools like Google Image Search can be extremely helpful for location identification.
- Itâ€™s important to pay attention to reporters and other distinctive elements in challenge videos, as they can help narrow down searches for matching content.
- Persistence in checking multiple related videos can eventually lead to the correct solution.
