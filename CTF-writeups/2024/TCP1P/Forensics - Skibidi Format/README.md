# Skibidi Format

Solved by: @arifpeycal

## Question:
So my friend just made a new image format and asked me to give him a test file, so I gave him my favorite png of all time. But the only thing I receive back is just my image with his new format and its “specification” file, don’t know what that is. Can you help me read this file?
