# OSINT - An Unlikely Partnership
Solved by **WanYin**

## Question
It appears that the Long Island Subway Authority (LISA) has made a strategic business partnership with a surprise influencer! See if you can figure out who.

This is part two of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. This challenge is possible without Hip With the Youth but will be easier if you start there.
