# OSINT - Hip With the Youth
Solved by **WanYin**

## Question
The Long Island Subway Authority (LISA), in an attempt to appeal to the younger generations, has begun experimenting with social media! See if you can find a way to a flag through their Instagram.

This is part one of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. I recommend starting here!

## Solution

Visit the Long Island Subway Authority's (LISA) Instagram profile.

From their Instagram profile, find the link to their Threads account. One of the posts contains the flag.
