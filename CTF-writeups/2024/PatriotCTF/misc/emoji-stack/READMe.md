```
Welcome to Emoji Stack, the brand new stack based emoji language! Instead of other stack based turing machines that use difficult to read and challenging characters like + - and [], Emoji Stack uses our proprietary patent pending emoji system.

The details of our implentation is below:

游녤: Move the stack pointer one cell to the right
游녣: Move the stack pointer one cell to the lef
游녨: Increment the current cell by one, bounded by 255
游녩: Decrement the current cell by one, bounded by 0
游눫: Print the ASCII value of the current cell
游대##: Repeat the previous instruction 0x## times
The Emoji Stack is 256 cells long, with each cell supporting a value between 0 - 255.

As an example, the program "游녨游대47游눫游녤游녨游대68游눫游녤游녨游대20游눫" Would output "Hi!" with the following execution flow:

[0, 0, 0, 0] 游녨游대47

[0x48, 0, 0, 0] 游눫游녤: H

[0x48, 0, 0, 0] 游녨游대68

[0x48, 0x69, 0, 0] 游눫游녤: i

[0x48, 0x69, 0, 0] 游녨游대20

[0x48, 0x69, 0x21, 0] 游눫: !
```

### Solutions:

```py
 RIGHT = ':point_right:'
LEFT = ':point_left:'
INC = ':thumbsup:'
DEC = ':thumbsdown:'
PRINT = ':speech_balloon:'
REPEAT = ':repeat:'

stack = [0] * 256
pointer = 0

with open('input.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    code = file.read()

i = 0  
while i < len(code):
    instruction = code[i]
    
    if instruction == RIGHT:
        pointer = (pointer + 1) % 256  
    elif instruction == LEFT:
        pointer = (pointer - 1) % 256  
    elif instruction == INC:
        stack[pointer] = (stack[pointer] + 1) % 256  
    elif instruction == DEC:
        stack[pointer] = (stack[pointer] - 1) % 256  
    elif instruction == PRINT:
        print(chr(stack[pointer]), end="")
    elif instruction == REPEAT:
        repeat_count = int(code[i + 1:i + 3], 16)  
        previous_instruction = code[i - 1]  

        for _ in range(repeat_count):
            if previous_instruction == RIGHT:
                pointer = (pointer + 1) % 256
            elif previous_instruction == LEFT:
                pointer = (pointer - 1) % 256
            elif previous_instruction == INC:
                stack[pointer] = (stack[pointer] + 1) % 256
            elif previous_instruction == DEC:
                stack[pointer] = (stack[pointer] - 1) % 256
            elif previous_instruction == PRINT:
                print(chr(stack[pointer]), end="")
        i += 2  
    
    i += 1
```
