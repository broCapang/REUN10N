- Description:

As you delve deeper into the tomb in search of answers, you stumble upon a puzzle room, its floor entirely covered in pressure plates. The warnings of the great necromancer, who hid his treasure here, suggest that one wrong step could lead to your doom.

You enter from the center of the eastern wall. Although you suspect you’re missing a crucial clue to guide your steps, you’re confident that everything you need to safely navigate the traps is already within reach.

At the center of the room lies the key to venturing further into the tomb, along with the promise of powerful treasures to aid you on your quest. Can you find the path, avoid the traps, and claim the treasure (flag) on the central platform?
