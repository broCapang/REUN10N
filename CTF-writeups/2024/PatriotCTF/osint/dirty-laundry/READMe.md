# Dirty Laundry

- Category: OSINT
- Description: 

We have been tracking the leader of an international crime ring, who we believe is laundering money through his girlfriend's business. We believe he is fleeing the country under the guise of a vacation with her. All we have on her is the name "Adrianna" and some business receipts from a "Patriot Corporation LLC". Can you help us figure out where these two have gone off to? (note: there will be a real flag for this with "PCTF" and all.)

### Solution:

- LinkedIn Profile of Adriana: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianna-hunnel-2b4267307/recent-activity/all/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianna-hunnel-2b4267307/recent-activity/all/)

- LinkedIn Profile of Her Partner: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/demetrius-trenderason-37a760329/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/demetrius-trenderason-37a760329/)

Their names are:
- Adrianna Hunnet
- Demetrius Trenderason

Their business email are:
- dtrenderason.patriotcorp@protonmail.com
- ahunnel.patriotcorp@protonmail.com
- ahunnel.patriotcorp@gmail.com

Next, send an email to the CEO and receive the flag.
