# Somewhere Near The Bay Part1
Solved by: @yappare

### Question: 
I've got a panorama picture of a landscape that I downloaded from Google Maps. I bet you can't find the exact location.

What's the location's What3Words? (don't put `\\\` inside the flag)

You might need to use [this](https://renderstuff.com/tools/360-panorama-web-viewer/) or [this](https://photo-sphere-viewer.js.org/playground.html)

The challenge image:
