# Somewhere Near The Bay Part2

Solved by: @gr1d

### Question:
I didn't think you could do it and honestly, I'm surprised!

That was pure luck, don't you think? Well, if you want to prove otherwise, you can do something crazy.

Can you tell me the legal name of the company that owns the bus in the picture?

Flag example: `FMCTF{MIDWEST_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOLUTIONS_LLC}` ALL UPPER CASE

### Solution:
The information of the company can be found in the website of [Department of the Secretary of State](https://apps3.web.maine.gov/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?MarkSumm=19940129+M)

**Flag:** `FMCTF{NATIONAL_PARK_TOURS_AND_TRANSPORT_INC}`
