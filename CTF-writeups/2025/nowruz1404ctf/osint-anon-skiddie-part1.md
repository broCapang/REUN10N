Solved by: @apik 

### Question:
We have a new team member who is still in training. The other day, he said he is trying to learn Git in order to contribute to our writeup website but he is still struggling with it.

Let's hope he hasn't exposed his email address.

### Solution:
The email can be found in this :[https://api.github.com/repos/M1Gh7yh4XxX0R/writeups/commits/83655a201eedec8764463755c5c64bd5949a5989](https://api.github.com/repos/M1Gh7yh4XxX0R/writeups/commits/83655a201eedec8764463755c5c64bd5949a5989 "https://api.github.com/repos/M1Gh7yh4XxX0R/writeups/commits/83655a201eedec8764463755c5c64bd5949a5989")
