## Question:
Could you help us out?

## Solution:
1. create and upload any hidden file, since hidden file wont be set as 000, this can be used as the reference file
2. upload `--reference=yourhiddenfile.txt`. `chmod 000 *` will now be executed and will set permission based on the hidden file permission just now.
3. check uploads/flag.txt

**Flag:** `x3c{4lw4y5_chm0d_y0ur3_f1l35_4_53cur17y}`
